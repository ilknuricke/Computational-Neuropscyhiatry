    - [Functional Neuropsychiatry - Functional Forum January 2016](https://youtu.be/R4c1-vCVwiE)
      With the massive increases in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, is there any hope for stemming this epidemic?
      New science is showing that a proactive approach to brain health can preventive and in some cases, reverse chronic conditions.
